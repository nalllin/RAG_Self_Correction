# Self Corrective RAG

## Problem Description
Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines can return incomplete or incorrect answers when retrieved context is noisy, irrelevant, or missing key facts. This project focuses on a self-corrective RAG workflow where the system evaluates response quality, identifies potential gaps, and iteratively improves retrieval and generation to produce more reliable, grounded answers.
